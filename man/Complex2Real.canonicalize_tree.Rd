\item{expr}{An \linkS4class{Expression} object.}

\item{real2imag}{A list mapping the ID of the real part of a complex expression to the ID of its imaginary part.}

\item{leaf_map}{A map that consists of a tree representation of the expression.}
}
\value{
A list of the parsed out real and imaginary components of the
expression that was constructed by performing the canonicalization of each leaf
in the tree.
